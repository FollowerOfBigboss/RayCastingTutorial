# Ray Casting Tutorial
A simple RayCasting rendering tutorial for game development

### Introduction

RayCasting is a technique to create a 3D projection based on 2D plane. This technique was used for old games when the computers didn't have a good performance like today computers. You can find this rendering method in [Wolfstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) thats is consider the first 3D game ever. The game [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) uses a similar technique known as [binary space partitioning (BSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning), but this tutorial is focused in the RayCasting implementation only.
